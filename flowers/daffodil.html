        <h2>About the Daffodil</h2>
        <p><strong>Narcissus</strong> is a genus of predominantly spring-blooming perennial plants of the amaryllis family, Amaryllidaceae. Commonly known as the daffodil or jonquil, it is a prominent symbol of spring, rebirth, and new beginnings.</p>
        
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Daffodils are herbaceous perennials that grow from a bulb. Their distinctive flowers are characterized by six petal-like tepals (the outer ring) surmounted by a central trumpet- or cup-shaped corona. While typically bright yellow or white, varieties exist in orange, pink, and with contrasting coronas.</p>
