        <h2>About the Hydrangea</h2>
        <p><strong>Hydrangea</strong> is a genus of over 75 species of flowering plants native to Asia and the Americas. It is a popular ornamental shrub, widely cultivated for its large, showy flower heads that bloom from summer to fall.</p>
        
        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Hydrangea flowers are produced in large clusters (corymbs), typically in "mophead" or "lacecap" forms. For many species, the flower color is affected by the soil's pH level: acidic soil produces blue flowers, while alkaline soil results in pink or red flowers. The colorful "petals" are actually modified leaves called sepals.</p>
